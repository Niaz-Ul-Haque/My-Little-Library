# My-Little-Library

When Books and other publications arrive in a library, they should be tagged and put on shelves, so they are easily retrievable to be lent out to those who need it.

Designed an application that receives the publications and stores them into the system with the information needed for their retrieval. Later, each publication can be lent out to members of the library with a due date for return.

Project Status - Complete.
